# Security Best Practices for Expense Manager

## API Keys and Sensitive Information

### ✅ DO

1. **Use Environment Variables**
   - Store all API keys, secrets, and credentials in environment variables
   - Use `.env` files for local development (with `.env.example` as a template)
   - Use platform-specific environment variable systems for production (Railway, Vercel, etc.)

2. **Validate Environment Variables**
   - Check for required environment variables at startup
   - Provide helpful error messages when variables are missing
   - Implement fallbacks for non-critical variables

3. **Mask Sensitive Data in Logs**
   - Never log full API keys or credentials
   - Use masking techniques (e.g., `key.substring(0, 4) + '...' + key.substring(key.length - 4)`)
   - Be careful with error messages that might expose sensitive data

4. **Implement Proper Error Handling**
   - Catch and handle errors from API calls
   - Provide generic error messages to users
   - Log detailed errors securely for debugging

5. **Use Secure Defaults**
   - Set secure defaults for all configuration options
   - Fail closed rather than open when security is at risk

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Never Hardcode Secrets**
   - Don't include API keys, passwords, or tokens in code
   - Don't commit secrets to version control
   - Don't share secrets in documentation or comments

2. **Avoid Insecure Storage**
   - Don't store secrets in client-side code
   - Don't store unencrypted secrets in databases
   - Don't use local storage for sensitive information

3. **Prevent Information Leakage**
   - Don't expose detailed error messages to users
   - Don't include sensitive data in URLs
   - Don't log sensitive information

## Authentication and Authorization

### ✅ DO

1. **Implement Strong Password Policies**
   - Require minimum length (at least 8 characters)
   - Require complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
   - Check against common password lists

2. **Use Secure Token Handling**
   - Store refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies
   - Set appropriate cookie security flags (Secure, SameSite)
   - Implement token rotation and revocation

3. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Limit login attempts
   - Add delays after failed attempts
   - Implement IP-based rate limiting for sensitive endpoints

4. **Use Proper Session Management**
   - Set reasonable token expiration times
   - Implement secure logout functionality
   - Allow users to manage active sessions

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Avoid Weak Authentication**
   - Don't use basic authentication over HTTP
   - Don't store passwords in plain text or with weak hashing
   - Don't use predictable token generation

2. **Prevent Session Hijacking**
   - Don't store session IDs in URLs
   - Don't use long-lived tokens without refresh mechanisms
   - Don't skip CSRF protection

## Input Validation and Data Handling

### ✅ DO

1. **Validate All Input**
   - Validate on both client and server
   - Use strong typing and schema validation
   - Sanitize user input before processing

2. **Implement Content Security Policy**
   - Set appropriate CSP headers
   - Restrict inline scripts and styles
   - Use nonces or hashes for necessary exceptions

3. **Use Parameterized Queries**
   - Use ORM or query builders with parameterization
   - Escape special characters in dynamic queries
   - Validate and sanitize database inputs

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Avoid Injection Vulnerabilities**
   - Don't concatenate strings to build SQL queries
   - Don't use `eval()` or similar functions with user input
   - Don't insert user input directly into HTML

2. **Prevent XSS Attacks**
   - Don't render unsanitized user input
   - Don't use `innerHTML` with user-provided content
   - Don't disable CSP or XSS protection

## Communication and Data Transfer

### ✅ DO

1. **Use HTTPS Everywhere**
   - Enforce HTTPS for all connections
   - Set appropriate security headers
   - Implement HSTS

2. **Implement Proper CORS Policy**
   - Restrict allowed origins
   - Limit allowed methods and headers
   - Use credentials mode appropriately

3. **Secure File Uploads and Downloads**
   - Validate file types and content
   - Scan for malware when possible
   - Store uploaded files outside the web root

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Avoid Insecure Communication**
   - Don't use HTTP for sensitive operations
   - Don't allow mixed content
   - Don't use weak TLS configurations

## Dependency Management

### ✅ DO

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update packages
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Monitor security advisories

2. **Minimize Dependencies**
   - Only use necessary packages
   - Prefer well-maintained libraries
   - Consider security implications of new dependencies

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Avoid Vulnerable Dependencies**
   - Don't use deprecated or unmaintained packages
   - Don't ignore security warnings
   - Don't use packages with known vulnerabilities

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### ✅ DO

1. **Implement Logging and Monitoring**
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Set up alerts for security incidents

2. **Have an Incident Response Plan**
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Document steps for common incidents
   - Practice response procedures

3. **Conduct Regular Security Reviews**
   - Perform code reviews with security focus
   - Use automated security scanning tools
   - Consider periodic penetration testing

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Don't Ignore Security Incidents**
   - Don't dismiss unusual activity
   - Don't delay security patches
   - Don't skip post-incident analysis
