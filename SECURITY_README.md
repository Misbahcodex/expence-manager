# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Expense Manager application to protect sensitive data, prevent common vulnerabilities, and ensure secure coding practices.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. API Key Protection

- Removed hardcoded API keys from all files
- Implemented environment variable usage for all sensitive credentials
- Added validation for API keys before usage
- Implemented masked logging for sensitive information

### 2. Secure Email Implementation

- Created a secure email utility (`secure-email.ts`) with:
  - Validation for API keys and recipient emails
  - Lazy initialization of email service
  - Environment variable usage
  - Masked logging
  - Fallback URL handling
  - Styled HTML content for emails

### 3. Security Scanning Tools

- Added `security-scan.js` script to detect:
  - Hardcoded API keys
  - Insecure configurations
  - Missing environment variables
  - Other security vulnerabilities

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks

- Implemented Husky pre-commit hooks to:
  - Run security scans before commits
  - Check for sensitive data in staged files
  - Prevent large files from being committed
  - Run linting

### 5. Documentation

- Created comprehensive security best practices document
- Updated deployment guides to use placeholders instead of real credentials
- Added security scripts to package.json

## How to Use Security Tools

### Running All Security Checks at Once

**For Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\run-security-checks.ps1
```

**For Windows Command Prompt:**
```cmd
run-security-checks.bat
```

**For Unix/Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x ./run-security-checks.sh
./run-security-checks.sh
```

### Running Individual Security Checks

#### Security Scan

```bash
npm run security:scan
```

This will scan the codebase for potential security issues and report them.

#### Checking Environment Variables

```bash
npm run security:check-env
```

This will check for sensitive data in environment files.

#### Testing Secure Email Implementation

**For Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\run-email-test.ps1
```

**For Windows Command Prompt:**
```cmd
run-email-test.bat
```

**For Unix/Linux/Mac:**
```bash
cd backend && npm run test:email
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The pre-commit hooks are automatically run when you attempt to commit changes. They will:

1. Run security scans
2. Check for sensitive data in staged files
3. Check for large files
4. Run linting

## Best Practices

Refer to the `SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md` file for detailed security guidelines covering:

- API key handling
- Authentication
- Input validation
- Secure communication
- Dependency management
- Monitoring and logging

## Security Maintenance

- Regularly run security scans
- Keep dependencies updated
- Review security best practices
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Update security tools as needed

## Contact

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them to the project maintainers immediately.
