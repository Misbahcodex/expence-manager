## Pre-Deployment Security Verification

Before deploying to production, run the all-in-one security check script:

### For Unix/Linux/Mac

```bash
chmod +x ./run-security-checks.sh
./run-security-checks.sh
```

### For Windows PowerShell

```powershell
.\run-security-checks.ps1
```

### For Windows Command Prompt

```cmd
run-security-checks.bat
```

### Or Run Individual Checks

#### For Unix/Linux/Mac

```bash
# Run security scan
npm run security:scan

# Check environment variables
npm run security:check-env

# Test secure email implementation
cd backend && npm run test:email

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

#### For Windows PowerShell

```powershell
# Run security scan
npm run security:scan

# Check environment variables
npm run security:check-env

# Test secure email implementation
.\run-email-test.ps1

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

#### For Windows Command Prompt

```cmd
# Run security scan
npm run security:scan

# Check environment variables
npm run security:check-env

# Test secure email implementation
run-email-test.bat

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

Address any issues found before proceeding with deployment.
