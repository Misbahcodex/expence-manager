## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Registration
1. Sign up with new email
2. Verify email using console URL
3. Login successfully
4. Access dashboard

### Scenario 2: Password Reset
1. Go to forgot password page
2. Enter your email
3. Check console for reset URL
4. Click reset URL
5. Set new password
6. Login with new password

### Scenario 3: Unverified User Login

### Scenario 4: Invalid Credentials
1. Try to login with wrong password
2. Should see "Invalid email or password" error

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If something doesn't work:

1. **Check backend console** for error messages
2. **Verify both servers are running**:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3001`
   - Backend: `http://localhost:4000`
3. **Check database connection** in backend console
4. **Clear browser cache** if needed

### Common Issues:

- **"User already exists"**: Use a different email address
- **"Invalid verification token"**: Use the exact URL from console
- **"Database error"**: Check if MySQL is running
- **"Network error"**: Check if backend server is running

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:

1. ✅ User registration shows success message
2. ✅ Verification URL appears in backend console
3. ✅ Email verification shows success message
4. ✅ Login redirects to dashboard
5. ✅ Dashboard shows user information
6. ✅ Logout works and redirects to login

## 📝 Notes

- **Development Mode**: No real emails are sent, URLs are logged to console
- **Production Setup**: Configure real email service for actual emails
- **Database**: Automatically creates required tables and columns
- **Security**: All passwords are hashed, tokens are secure

Your auth system is now complete and ready for use! 🚀
